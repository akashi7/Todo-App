## Technologies

1. Vite React with JavaScript
2. react18next for localization
3. Redux ToolKit and Redux toolkit Query
4. Tailwind Css
5. Jest & React Testing Library

I chose Redux Toolkit Query over React Query because it is bundled with Redux Toolkit. and While using the dummy API, I observed that it only indicates successful request completion without providing actual updating, editing, or adding functionalities.
